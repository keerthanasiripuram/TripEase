# TripEase

A comprehensive travel management application developed to enhance my skills in the MERN 
stack, with Python integration for machine learning features. The intuition behind creating this 
project was to build a unified platform that addresses common travel needs, making trip planning 
and management more efficient and enjoyable.

It includes the following features:
### Document Management with OTP Verification: 
To Securely upload and manage travel documents, ensuring safety through OTP-based authentication using TwilioAccount for added security.

Enables groups to split expenses based on shares, percentages, or equally, facilitating smooth financial management among travelers.
### Trip Monitoring: 
Track and manage trip details such as trip names, dates, and related expenses, offering a clear overview of travel plans and costs.
### Weather Information: 
Integrated with the OpenWeather API to provide users with current and forecasted weather information at their travel destination, helping them plan better.
### Place and Hotel Recommendations: 
Uses machine learning algorithms and data from Kaggle to suggest the best places and hotels to visit based on the google ratings.
### Translator: 
Integrated with the Google Translate API, this feature allows users to translate text in real-time, making communication easier when traveling to different destinations. It supports multiple languages, enhancing the user experience by breaking down language barriers.
