# TripEase

A comprehensive travel management application developed to enhance my skills in the MERN 
stack, with Python integration for machine learning features. The intuition behind creating this 
project was to build a unified platform that addresses common travel needs, making trip planning 
and management more efficient and enjoyable.

It includes the following features:
### Document Management with OTP Verification: 
To Securely upload and manage travel documents, ensuring safety through OTP-based authentication for added security.
### Location and Nearby Spotting: 
To Utilize OpenLayers to detect the userâ€™s current location and display nearby attractions, enhancing the travel experience with real-time location data.
